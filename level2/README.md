<h1>Educational matching</h1>
We want to help families to find a teacher regarding their needs in term of fields and levels. This is what we do at MyMentor. 
In the exercice you created new teachers. Now we want you to save a client request for private tuition. 
<h2>Specifications</h2>
We want to :
<ul>
  <li>
    Create and save a Request that includes the fullname of a client, a field and a level.
  </li>
  <li>
    Search for teachers who match with a specific Request regarding its field and level. We have to return a collection of teachers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Update the request with the reference of one of the teachers who fit with the request. He will be the teacher selected by the client.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Feel free to improve the UX. We want to be able to execute a ruby file that will store the requests in data.json.
