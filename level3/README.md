<h1>Educational matching</h1>
We want to help families to find a teacher regarding their needs in term of fields and levels. This is what we do at MyMentor. 
In the previous exercice you have created new teachers and chose one as private tutor for a specific client request. Now we would like to add a collection of new courses and a price per hour to the Request.
<h2>Specifications</h2>
We want to :
<ul>
  <li>add a new course for a specific request that will include the length of the course, a date
  </li>
  <li>Update a Request with a price per hour</li>
  <li>Compute the total price for all the courses of a specific request</li>
  <li><i>(optionnal)</i> Compute the total price of courses between two dates</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We want to be able to execute a file that will store the objects in the output.json file.
